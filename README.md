# TummyHub - front-end

## About the Project
This was my final project for web development bootcamp (MIT Xpro).  You can see my deployed version [here](https://kathryn-michael-fullstackrestaurantapplication.vercel.app/).

The starter code was provided to me by the program, and is based on [Ryan Belke's Deliveroo tutorial](https://strapi.io/blog/nextjs-react-hooks-strapi-food-app-1) for Strapi version 3. 

## Getting Started
Install dependencies. 
Add your Stripe API private key to ./pages/checkout.js.

Add your backend API_URL to:
./pages/_app.js
./lib/auth.js
./lib/auth/client.js
./components/checkout.js

Add your email address to ./pages/contact.js and update ./pages/about.js to reflect your iteration.
